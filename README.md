## Visual Design
I drew inspiration for the visual design from the resumes and portfolios of other artists and creatives. The design incorporates elements reflecting both my artistic background and IT expertise.
I aimed to balance a visually engaging design with user-friendly minimalism. This approach ensures that my CV is easy to read and navigate, while still reflecting my creative side and proficiency in IT-related fields.
